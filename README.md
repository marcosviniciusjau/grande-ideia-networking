# Grande Ideia Networking
Gande Ideia Networking is a website that allows users to create, update, and delete events. The website is built with the Laravel framework.

# Technical Features

The website uses the following technical features to implement the event management functionality:

# Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture

# MVC Architecture

The MVC architecture separates the website into three layers:

# Model: The model layer represents the data and logic for the events.
# View: The view layer renders the HTML for the website.
Controller: The controller layer handles the requests from the user and interacts with the model layer.
Eloquent ORM

# Eloquent is a Laravel ORM that provides an object-oriented interface for interacting with the database. The website uses Eloquent to create, update, and delete events.

# Validation

Validation is used to ensure that the data submitted by the user is valid. The website uses Laravel's built-in validation features to validate the data submitted for events.

# Usage

To use the event management functionality, users must first create an account. Once they have created an account, they can create new events. To create a new event, users must provide the following information:

Title: The title of the event.
Description: A description of the event.
Date: The date of the event.
Time: The time of the event.
Location: The location of the event.
Once an event has been created, users can update it or delete it. To update an event, users must provide the new information for the event. To delete an event, users must click the "Delete" button.

# Conclusion

Grande Ideia Networking is a website that provides a simple and easy-to-use way for users to create, update, and delete events. The website is built with the Laravel framework and uses a variety of technical features to implement the functionality.
